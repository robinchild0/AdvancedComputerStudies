THere is a random point where things stop working but I cant pin point what is causing it so I am going to just kep typing until maybe I can figure out what is causing it because I have no clue so here goes nothing: Oh um what is it the init is what you want to convert to numbers and then the last is your next place to start wiht or the init plus last which is the entire thing is what goes into the dictionary why is this getting stuck already Time to add even more words to this sentence and run it through a massive stress test to ensure that nothing will ever break when it gets longer or differetn amounts of bits get added to the string we will also try to figure out what number of bits will create the smalles string compression size. It might be easier for me to simply make a method to do it for me but who really knows.
